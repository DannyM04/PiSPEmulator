PiSP Emulator UI

A Python Tkinter-based UI for a Raspberry Pi CM4 handheld emulator.
The UI currently allows users to browse through different emulators (PSP, N64, PC). All optimised for fullscreen usage.

Current Features:
- Fullscreen Tkinter GUI tailored for Raspberry Pi CM4
- Home screen with buttons to select emulator platforms (PSP, N64, PC)
- Dedicated screens for each emulator with placeholder messages
- Consistent UI style with dark theme and flat buttons
- Navigation buttons including a "Home" button on emulator screens
- Escape key binding to exit application

Future Goals (In no particular order):
- Allow the system to access Emulator files and run games from application
- Create settings menu for resolution, Bluetooth headphones, and a dev mode option for future updates
- Create assets for UI to replace placeholders
- Create a sleek, and maybe customisable, opening animation for the application (on startup)
- Implement home menu music for application
- Design application to be navigated with buttons
- Implement animations for selecting different emulators
- Display a warning for when the emulator's battery is low

Prerequisites:
Python 3.11
Tkinter 

Notes:
- This is a very early prototype of the emulator's UI used to show the most basic functions. Thank you for following the development of the PiSP.
